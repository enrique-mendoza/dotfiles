# set by alacritty itself.
env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.

# Bindings are always filled by default, but will be replaced when a new

#
# If the same trigger is assigned to multiple actions, all of them are executed
# in the order they were defined in.
